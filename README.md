# DASH
Dash lets users stay connected to friends and family by planning events for them to all to together.

The goal was to create a single page application user React.js for a frontend and a ruby on rails backend api.

In development, I used D3.js to create a bubble chart of user created categories, Filestack to host the user images, bcrypt for authentication, and EventfulAPI to pull in events from a user's hometown.

# Concerns and Issues
- There is plenty of refactoring to be done in order to make cleaner and clearer code
- Need to incorporate JWT in order to use tokens for user Authentication
- Would like to change the Action Mailer format for the emails to look nicer
- Add google authentication when a user logs in.
